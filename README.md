Hello! Welcome to the Scala Skeleton REPO.

You will need to modify Compiler.scala as well as the Scanner, Parser, and Token files as you see fit. This is just a minimal suggestion for your project's organization. Feel free to change them and/or add any other files. Ultimately, the only constraint is that the `run.sh` and `build.sh` correctly run your compiler.

Happy parsing!
